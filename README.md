# RNAsim-Subset
Create a Dataset to simulate the Greengenes dataset, which contains ~200k 16S from bacteria and archaea. Use a long branch in the tree of RNA-sim 1M taxa to simulate the split position of bacteria and archaea. From there, sample bacteria in 1 subtree and archaea in the other subtree.
